# DataParser
## A C# Console Application for Parsing Data

###Instructions

Git clone this repository, which contains a few sample data files to get started.

Run this program from the command line. I recommed a C# compiler called [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/).

It will process any files in the same directory that end in .data, and will print statistical information for each file.

The format for the data files must be a string representing space-separated numbers: 123.23 45 345.4 44545.3, etc.
